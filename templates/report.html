These algorithms are specifically designed for two fundamental tasks: constructing convex hulls and detecting intersections between lines. The construction of convex hulls involves finding the smallest pos- sible convex shape that encloses a given set of points. Simul- taneously, the detection of line intersections focuses on iden- tifying points where two or more lines cross each other. By analyzing the implementation and outcomes of these geomet- ric algorithms, this report aims to provide insights into their efficiency and applicability in solving real-world problems.</p><h1><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>This project explores the computational geometry domain, fo- cusing on the design and analysis of algorithms that find con- vex hulls and line intersections.</p><h1><a id="Background"></a>Background</h1><h2><a id="Convex Hull Problem"></a>Convex Hull Problem</h2><p>The Convex Hull problem is a fundamental concept in com- putational geometry. Given a set of points in the Euclidean plane, the convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that en- closes all the points. Formally, it is the intersection of all convex sets containing the given points. Convex hulls have widespread applications in areas such as computer graphics, pattern recognition, and robotics.</p><p>The problem can be formally stated as follows: Given a set of points <em>P </em>= (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub><em>, y</em><sub>1</sub>)<em>, </em>(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub><em>, y</em><sub>2</sub>)<em>, . . . , </em>(<em>x<sub>n</sub>, y<sub>n</sub></em>) , find the convex hull, denoted as <em>CH</em>(<em>P </em>), which is the convex polygon formed by the subset of points.</p><p><em>{	}</em></p><p>Various algorithms exist to compute the convex hull, such as Graham&#39;s scan, Jarvis march, and QuickHull. These al- gorithms differ in their efficiency and approach but share the common goal of determining the convex hull in a time com- plexity that is optimal or near-optimal.</p><h2><a id="Line Intersection Problem"></a>Line Intersection Problem</h2><p>The Line Intersection problem involves determining if and where two or more line segments intersect in the Euclidean plane. This problem is crucial in computer graphics, geo- graphic information systems, and computational geometry.</p><p>Given a set of line segments <em>L </em>= <em>l</em><sub>1</sub><em>, l</em><sub>2</sub><em>, . . . , l<sub>m</sub> </em>, where each line segment is defined by two endpoints, the goal is to identify all intersections between these line segments. An intersection occurs when two line segments share a common point.</p><p><em>{	}</em></p><p>The Line Intersection problem has applications in various fields, including robotics path planning, computer-aided de- sign, and computational biology.</p><p>Efficient algorithms, such as the sweep line algorithm and Brute Force, have been developed to address the Line Inter- section problem. These algorithms aim to provide accurate and fast solutions for identifying intersecting line segments within a given set.</p><p>In the following sections, we will delve into specific algo- rithms and methodologies employed to solve the Convex Hull and Line Intersection problems.</p><h1><a id="Programming Design"></a>Programming Design</h1><p>In developing solutions for the Convex Hull and Line Inter- section problems, we chose to implement the algorithms using the Python programming language, leveraging its readability, versatility, and extensive libraries for mathematical computa- tions and geometry.</p><h2><a id="Choice of Programming Language"></a>Choice of Programming Language</h2><p>Python was selected as the programming language for its sim- plicity, ease of understanding, and a rich ecosystem of li- braries, particularly those related to computational geometry. The expressive syntax of Python allows for a concise and clear implementation of complex algorithms, facilitating code read- ability and maintenance.</p><h2><a id="Object-Oriented Design"></a>Object-Oriented Design</h2><p>To enhance code organization and modularity, we adopted object-oriented principles in our programming design. We</p><p>structured the implementation using classes and objects, en- capsulating relevant functionalities within each class. This approach promotes code reusability and makes it easier to ex- tend or modify the system in the future.</p></body></html>
